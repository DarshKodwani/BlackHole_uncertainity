The trajectory of the observer and the position from which the photons are emitted are represented by solid blue lines. The bottom part is a general case of two Hawking photons coming from a distance $r_A$ from the black hole of mass $M$ and arriving at an observer who is at a distance of $r_0$. The top part shows two Hawking photons coming from the same distance $r_A$ from a black hole of mass $M$. Instead of the photons freely propagating through to an observer at $r_0$, they have to cross two shells, represented by blue dotted line, of equal and opposite mass $-\Delta M, \Delta M$ at $r_{1}, r_{2}$ respectively.
